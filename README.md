# GitHub Organization Profile

GitHub Organizations (and user profiles) can use a special repository named `.github` to display a public README on that user's/organization's homepage.

For our purposes, we can use this to display some info about the convention, why this organization exists, and how to apply for staff if someone is interested.

The contents of [profile/README.md](./profile/README.md) is what is displayed publicly. Other supporting files here are also publicly viewable but only when viewed via this repository. Please refer to GitHub's [Profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile) documentation and the GitHub [Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more info.
